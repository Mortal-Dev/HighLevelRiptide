# HighLevelRiptide

High level riptide (HLR) uses Riptide to create a simple, fast, and easy to use Netcode solution with similar functionality to Mirror.

The reason I made this was because I was unhappy with the code generation in Mirror and other popular netcode solutions, which I believe overly abstracts execution flow from the developer, so I decided to create my own solution using a slightly modified version of Riptide for data transport.

HLR is faster because of the use of types and caching, allowing speedy execution of command methods, in comparison to reflection and code generation used in other popular netcode solutions.

The code provided in this repo comes with an example to help you get used to how this works.  This is not finished and the API is subject to change.
