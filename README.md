# HighLevelRiptide

High level riptide (HLR) uses Riptide to create a simple, fast, and easy to use Netcode solution similar to Mirror.

The reason I made this was because I was unhappy with the aggressive use of reflection in Mirror, and decided to create my own solution using a slightly modified version of Riptide.

HLR is faster mostly because of the use of types and caching, allowing speedy execution of command methods.

The code provided in this repo comes with an example to help you get used to how this works.  This is not finished and the API is most likely subject to change, but I'll do my best to keep it the same.
